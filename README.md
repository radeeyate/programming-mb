# programming-mb
Some little scripts that I made for the Programming Merit Badge for Scouts BSA

#WallPaper.ps1
This script I wrote in Windows Powershell. It basically allows you to choose an username from Unsplash or a keyword, and every minute, it grabs images and sets it as your desktop background using registry keys.

#temperature.py
Basically reads the fahrenheit temperature you input an gives you a cool message with colors telling you what to do. Written in Python.

#calc.go
A calculator written in Go. Instead of requiring three inputs (#1, operator #2), it only needs on input. It splits the input by where the operator is, and does the equation for whatever the two numbers are.
